## PROJECT_IMAGE_CAPTIONING
With the help of this project, machine can generate its own captions related to the image. The model uses Flickr dataset for training data and uses LSTM for training.
## The Model made contains:
Image model: for reducing image of high dimensions into selected features.
Language model: for creating output as embeddings to reduce complexity of model.
Final model: which will concatenate results of both this model and will use LSTM layer and Time Distributed layer for doing final_predicttions.
## One of example of final prediction:
